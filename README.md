This is the work of my internship at IEM of CSIC, in Madrid. A research institute dedicated to the theoritical understanding of the properties of matter. 

This internship was an opportunity for me to learn about the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene. The work was exploratory in nature, not intending to push currect research,
but rather trying to reproduce the work of some historical papers in the area. 

Specifically, I found properties of the bands of TBG under several models/approximations in the case with no interactions. I reproduced (partially in some cases, due to the limitations
of my methods) the work of Lopes dos Santos et al. (2007), and Bistritzer and MacDonald (2011). See the following references:
- https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.256802
- https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1108174108

Further, I investigated the band topology of TBG in the continuum model of Bistritzer and MacDonald, (and later Lopes dos Santos et al. in 2012, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.86.155449)
and found nontrivial Chern numbers at different values of the angle in TBG through several of the magic angle values (indicating no topological phase transitions <--> band crossings).

Some of the useful reading was due to Kohmoto (1984), and Asbóth, Oroszlány, and Pályi. See the following references>
